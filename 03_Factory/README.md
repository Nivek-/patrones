Creational Patterns - Factory Pattern

When to use a Factory Pattern?
The Factory patterns can be used in following cases:
   1. When a class does not know which class of objects it must create.
   2. A class specifies its sub-classes to specify which objects to create.
   3. In programmerâ€™s language (very raw form), you can use factory pattern where you have to create an object of any one of sub-classes depending on the data provided.
